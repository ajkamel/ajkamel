# Ash Kamel's Manager README

## üëã Introduction

Hi there! I'm Ash Kamel, an engineering leader at GitHub. I've spent over a decade scaling complex systems and building high-performing engineering teams across companies like Zip Co, SoulCycle, and various startups. I created this document to give you insight into how I operate, what you can expect from me, and what I believe makes teams successful.
This is a living document that will evolve as I learn and grow. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or provide feedback!

## üß≠ My Leadership Philosophy

### No Surprises
One of my core principles is avoiding surprises‚Äîboth for you and for me. I believe in transparent, proactive communication that allows us to navigate challenges together before they become problems.

### First Principles Thinking
I value solving problems from first principles rather than relying solely on established patterns. This means questioning assumptions and being open to innovative approaches when the situation calls for it.

### Balanced Growth
I believe the best teams balance immediate delivery with long-term growth. Technical excellence matters, but it should serve our users and business goals rather than being pursued for its own sake.

### Iteration Over Perfection
I believe in shipping early and learning quickly. Perfect is the enemy of good, and we often learn more from real feedback than from theoretical discussions. I encourage incremental changes that reduce risk and accelerate our collective learning.

## üíº How I Work

### Communication Style
- I tend to be direct but considerate
- I prefer written communication for complex topics that require thought
- For urgent matters, don't hesitate to ping me directly
- I try to respond to messages within 4 hours during working hours

### Decision Making
From my experience launching new markets at Quadpay and driving cross-functional projects at Zip, I've developed a framework for decision-making that considers:

- Impact (business, user, technical)
- Urgency
- Recoverability
- Who needs to be involved

When time permits, I aim for consensus; when urgency dictates, I'll make decisive calls while communicating my reasoning.

### Meeting Philosophy
I believe meetings should have clear purposes:

- Decision-making
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Alignment and information sharing

I'm not a fan of status update meetings that could be handled asynchronously (outside of team bonding/demo type gatherings). Every meeting should have an agenda and end with clear next steps.

## üß© My Quirks & Working Style

### What Works Well

- I appreciate direct communication‚Äîdon't hesitate to push back on my ideas
- I enjoy diving into technical details occasionally, but trust you to own the implementation
- I value data and metrics in discussions about performance and decisions

### Potential Blind Spots

- I can sometimes move too quickly when excited about an idea
- I occasionally need to be reminded to celebrate wins before moving to the next challenge

### How to Give Me Feedback

- Be direct and specific
- Focus on impact rather than intent (intent is still important just dont lose sight of the goal)

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personal Notes
Outside of work, I'm passionate about soccer‚ÄîI spent many years as a referee and coach for the U.S. Soccer Federation. This experience taught me a lot about quick decision-making, maintaining composure under pressure, and the importance of fair play.  There is often an anology you might hear me repeat about how when managing a match you often perform like an orchestra conductor where keeping a finger on the pulse of the game and all the inputs come together in a complex web of decisions and non decisons that need to be made. The goal is to put on the best performance possible where the players (team) get to shine and the audiance (customers) recieved a delightful experience.

I'm energized by solving complex problems, mentoring others, and seeing teams deliver impactful work that propels themselves and their organizations forward.

This README is meant to start our working relationship with clarity and transparency. It's not exhaustive, and I look forward to learning more about how we can work together effectively. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or provide feedback on how I can better support you!
