# Ash Kamel's Manager README

## üëã Introduction

Hi there! I'm Ash Kamel, an engineering leader at GitHub. I've spent over a decade scaling complex systems and building high-performing engineering teams across companies like Zip Co, SoulCycle, and various startups. I created this document to give you insight into how I operate, what you can expect from me, and what I believe makes teams successful.

This is a living document that will evolve as I learn and grow. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or provide feedback!

## üß≠ My Leadership Philosophy

### No Surprises

One of my core principles is avoiding surprises‚Äîboth for you and for me. I believe in transparent, proactive communication that allows us to navigate challenges together before they become problems.

### First Principles Thinking

I value solving problems from first principles rather than relying solely on established patterns. This means questioning assumptions and being open to innovative approaches when the situation calls for it. I also believe that there is a time and place for this type of thinking, and being able to collaborate effectively and respecting our peers is as equally important.

### Balanced Growth

I believe the best teams balance immediate delivery with long-term growth. Technical excellence matters, but it should serve our users and business goals rather than being pursued for its own sake.

### Iteration Over Perfection

I believe in shipping early and learning quickly. Perfect is the enemy of good, and we often learn more from real feedback than from theoretical discussions. I encourage incremental changes that reduce risk and accelerate our collective learning.

## üíº How I Work

### Communication & Decision Making

- I communicate directly but thoughtfully, preferring written format for complex topics
- For urgent matters, please reach out directly (I aim to respond within 4 hours during work hours)
- My decision-making weighs impact, urgency, recoverability, and stakeholder input
- When time permits, I seek consensus; when needed, I'll make the call and explain my reasoning

### Meeting Philosophy

- I value focused meetings with clear agendas and outcomes
- Every meeting should serve a specific purpose: decisions, problem-solving, or alignment
- Status updates belong in documentation, not meetings (team demos and bonding are exceptions)

## ü§ù What You Can Expect From Me

### Support

- Regular 1:1s that focus on your growth, not status updates
- Removing obstacles so you can do your best work
- Context about how your work connects to broader goals
- Advocating for you and your career growth

### Feedback

- Timely, specific feedback aimed at growth
- Recognition of your accomplishments and impact
- Transparency about areas for improvement
- A safe space to experiment and learn from mistakes

### Growth

- Opportunities that stretch your abilities
- Coaching and mentorship tailored to your goals
- Connecting you with resources and people who can help you grow
- Regular career development conversations

## üîç What I Expect From You

### Ownership

- Take responsibility for your commitments
- Communicate proactively about risks or blockers
- Seek help when needed, but try solutions first
- Look beyond immediate tasks to understand impact

### Continuous Learning

- Be curious and open to new approaches
- Share knowledge with the team
- Reflect on successes and failures
- Stay current with relevant technologies and practices

### Team Support

- Collaborate effectively with peers
- Provide constructive feedback when asked
- Help maintain our team culture
- Consider the needs of the broader organization and committing to our working agreements

## üß© My Quirks & Working Style

### What Works Well

- I appreciate direct communication‚Äîdon't hesitate to push back on my ideas
- I enjoy diving into technical details occasionally, but trust you to own the implementation
- I value data and metrics in discussions about performance and decisions

### Potential Blind Spots

- I can sometimes move too quickly when excited about an idea
- I occasionally need to be reminded to celebrate wins before moving to the next challenge

### How to Give Me Feedback

- Be direct and specific
- Focus on impact rather than intent (intent is still important just don't lose sight of the goal)
- Suggest alternatives when possible
- Don't wait for a formal review‚Äîimmediate feedback is valuable

## üóìÔ∏è Our 1:1s

### Structure

- We'll meet weekly or bi-weekly for 30 minutes depending on your preference
- The time is primarily yours‚Äîcome with topics you want to discuss
- I'll occasionally have specific topics to cover, but your agenda takes priority

### Suggested Topics

- Career development and goals
- Team dynamics and collaboration
- Technical challenges you're facing
- Work satisfaction and balance
- Ideas for improving our processes or products

### Making Them Valuable

- Come prepared with topics or questions
- Be open about challenges you're facing
- Use the time for discussions that benefit from synchronous conversation
- Let me know if the format isn't working for you

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personal Notes

I live just outside of NYC with my spouse and two kids. I love to travel (though not as much these days), hike in the Hudson Valley, and ski/snowboard when I can. My reading lately focuses on people leadership and entrepreneurship, though you'll still catch me diving into a great white paper or engineering blog post.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about soccer‚ÄîI spent many years as a match official and referee coach for the U.S. Soccer Federation. This experience taught me a lot about quick decision-making, maintaining composure under pressure, and the importance of fair play.

You might hear me use this analogy: managing a soccer match is like being an orchestra conductor. You keep a finger on the pulse of the game while processing countless inputs that form a complex web of decisions and non-decisions. The goal is to put on the best performance possible where the players (team) get to shine and the audience (customers) enjoys a delightful experience.

I'm energized by solving complex problems, mentoring others, and seeing teams deliver impactful work that propels themselves and their organizations forward.

This README is meant to start our working relationship with clarity and transparency. It's not exhaustive, and I look forward to learning more about how we can work together effectively. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or provide feedback on how I can better support you!
